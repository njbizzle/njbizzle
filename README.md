If you're seeing this as a portfolio for a college application, thank you for taking the time to look this over! 

I've made a few recent projects public and pinned them below this text box. Clicking through any of the projects will lead you to a page with all of the code, and if you scroll down there will be a section that outlines each of the projects, specific features and challenges, as well as photo and video resources.
