If you're seeing this as a portfolio for a college application, thank you for taking the time to look over this! 

I made a few recent projects public and pinned right below this text box. Clicking through will lead you to a page with all the code, but if you scroll down there will be a readme section with a description of the project.

I also want to apologize for typos in the older commit messages (you most likely wont see them unless you're looking). They're going to be especially prevalent in the personal projects, I wasn't always planning on showcasing some of these projects.
