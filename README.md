If you're seeing this as a portfolio for a college application, thank you for taking the time to look over this! 

I have four of my recent projects pinned at the top of the page. Clicking through will lead you to a page with all the code, but scrolling down there will be a section with a description of the projects, and different aspects that I want to highlight about it.
